<p>My name is Forrest, and I am proud to serve the Conroe community as a certified biohazard and trauma cleanup technician. For the past three years, I’ve dedicated my career to helping families and businesses recover from challenging and sensitive situations — from unattended deaths to trauma scenes.</p>

<p>Being AMDECON-certified ensures that every cleanup I perform meets the highest industry standards for safety, disinfection, and respectful handling of sensitive situations. I am passionate about my work, and I treat every scene with the utmost care and discretion.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I am a husband and a father to two wonderful daughters. My family keeps me grounded and reminds me daily why I do what I do — providing peace of mind and a safe environment for others during their most vulnerable moments.</p>

<p>Through this blog, I’ll share insights about biohazard cleanup, safety tips, industry news, and the compassionate philosophy that guides every job we take on at Hope Renewed LLC. I hope you find the information helpful, and I look forward to connecting with the community through these posts.</p>

<p>Thank you for trusting Hope Renewed LLC. Together, we restore safety, dignity, and hope.</p></div>
