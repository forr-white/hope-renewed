    <h3>What Is Suicide Cleanup?</h3>
    <p>
      Suicide cleanup is the professional process of remediating spaces affected by a suicide. It requires specialized training, protective equipment, and technical expertise to ensure safety, compliance, and discretion throughout the process.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Biohazard Removal:</strong> Safe removal of all bloodborne pathogens and biological materials</li>
      <li><strong>Complete Sanitization:</strong> Comprehensive cleaning and disinfection of all affected surfaces</li>
      <li><strong>Odor Remediation:</strong> Neutralizing odors at their molecular source—not just masking them</li>
      <li><strong>Discreet Service:</strong> Protecting your privacy with compassion and professionalism</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Our technicians are highly trained to manage these sensitive scenes with technical precision and empathy, allowing families to focus on healing while we restore the affected space.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Professional Cleanup Is Essential</h3>
    <p>
      In the aftermath of a suicide, cleanup should never fall on loved ones. Professional remediation is essential for both safety and peace of mind.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Health Hazards:</strong> Exposure to biological materials poses serious health risks, even when contaminants are not visible.</li>
      <li><strong>Improper Sanitization:</strong> Household cleaning products cannot effectively decontaminate biohazard-affected areas. We use hospital-grade, EPA-approved solutions to ensure full remediation.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional Trauma:</strong> Attempting to clean such scenes can deeply worsen grief and psychological distress.</li>
      <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Our team follows all OSHA, EPA, and state regulations for proper disposal of biohazardous waste.</li>
    </ul>

      At <strong>Hope Renewed</strong>, we follow a proven, compassionate process that ensures complete restoration while minimizing disruption.
    </p>

    <h4>Immediate Response</h4>

      Our 24/7 dispatch team coordinates rapid response, typically arriving within hours to begin the containment and remediation process.
    </p>

    <h4>Compassionate Assessment</h4>
    <p>
      Every situation is handled with care. Our technicians conduct a respectful evaluation to create a customized cleanup plan that meets your specific needs.
    </p>

    <h4>Secure Containment</h4>
    <p>
      We establish protective containment zones to prevent cross-contamination and safeguard unaffected areas of your home or property.
    </p>

    <h4>Biohazard Removal</h4>
    <p>
      Using proper protective gear and following strict safety standards, we safely remove all biological materials for regulated disposal.
    </p>

    <h4>Advanced Decontamination</h4>
    <p>
      Our team applies hospital-grade disinfectants and advanced cleaning technology to eliminate all biological and microbial hazards.
    </p>

    <h4>Odor Elimination</h4>
    <p>
      We neutralize lingering odors at the molecular level using ozone and enzymatic treatments, ensuring no residual scent remains.
    </p>

    <h4>Final Restoration</h4>
    <p>
      Once cleanup and decontamination are complete, we restore the area to a safe, habitable condition—free of visible or invisible traces of the event.
