  <h3>Immediate Response</h3>
  <p>
    Our 24/7 response team is ready to act at a moment’s notice. We typically arrive within hours of your call to contain the situation quickly and prevent further contamination or damage.
  </p>

  <h3>Comprehensive Assessment</h3>
  <p>
    Every situation is unique. Our technicians perform a meticulous inspection to identify all impacted areas—including those where biological contaminants may not be immediately visible.
  </p>

  <h3>Secure Containment</h3>
  <p>
    To safeguard the rest of your home or property, we establish secure containment zones. This prevents cross-contamination and protects unaffected areas during the cleanup process.
  </p>

  <h3>Biohazard Removal</h3>
  <p>
    Equipped with full protective gear, our specialists remove and dispose of all biological materials safely and discreetly, adhering strictly to OSHA, EPA, and state regulations.
  </p>

  <h3>Advanced Decontamination</h3>
  <p>
    We use medical-grade disinfectants, ATP-tested cleaning agents, and advanced tools to ensure every surface is properly sanitized—even in hard-to-reach areas.
  </p>

  <h3>Molecular Odor Elimination</h3>
  <p>
    Decomposition odors are treated at their source, not masked. We apply enzymatic and ozone-based odor neutralization techniques to fully eliminate unpleasant smells at the molecular level.
  </p>

  <h3>Structural Remediation</h3>
  <p>
    If contamination has affected building materials, we remove or restore damaged areas, ensuring your property’s integrity and safety are fully restored.
  </p>

  <h3>Final Verification & Restoration</h3>
  <p>
    Our final step includes ATP surface testing to verify a hospital-level standard of cleanliness. Once confirmed, we restore the space to a safe, habitable condition—free from visible and invisible traces of the incident.
